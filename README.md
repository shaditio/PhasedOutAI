# PhasedOutAI
## An AI for the card game 'Phased Out'
The following program is a project in my Year 1 in University of Melbourne. It is written in Python.

## Sections of the project
### Part 1 (Q1)
A function called phasedout_group_type that takes the following single argument 'group' where 'group' is a group of cards in the form of a list,each element of which is a 2-character string with the value (drawn from '234567890JQKA') followed by the suit (drawn from 'SHDC').

What is returned, is one of the following values, indicating the type of group of cards contained in group:
- **1:** A set of three cards of the same value, e.g. ['2C', '2S', '2H'] represents a set of three Twos. Note that the set may include Wilds, but must include at least two "natural" cards (i.e. non-Wild cards), which define the value. Note also that the sequence of the cards is not significant for this group type.
- **2:** A set of 7 cards of the same suit, e.g. ['2C', '2C', '4C', 'KC', '9C', 'AH', 'JC'] represents a set of seven Clubs. Note that the set may include Wilds (as we see in our example, with the Ace of Hearts), but must include at least two "natural" cards (i.e. non-Wild card), which define the suit. Note also that the sequence of the cards is not significant for this group type.
- **3:** A set of four cards of the same value, e.g. ['4H', '4S', 'AC', '4C'] represents a set of four Fours. Note that the set may include Wilds (as we see in our example, with the Ace of Clubs), but must include at least two "natural" cards (i.e. non-Wild cards), which define the value. Note also that the sequence of the cards is not significant for this group type.
- **4:** A run of eight cards, e.g. ['4H', '5S', 'AC', '7C', '8H', 'AH', '0S', 'JC'] represents a run of eight cards. Note that the set may include Wilds (as we see in our example, with the Ace of Clubs standing in for a Six and the Ace of Hearts standing in for a Nine), but must include at least two "natural" cards (i.e. non-Wild cards). Note also that the sequence of the cards is significant for this group type, and that ['4H', '5S', 'AC', '8H', '7C', 'AH', '0S', 'JC'], e.g., is not a valid run of eight, as it is not in sequence.
- **5:** A run of four cards of the same colour, e.g. ['4H', '5D', 'AC', '7H'] represents a run of four Red cards. Note that the set may include Wilds (as we see in our example, with the Ace of Clubs standing in for a Red Six), but must include at least two "natural" cards (i.e. non-Wild cards), which define the colour. Note also that the sequence of the cards is significant for this group type, and that ['4H', '5D', '7H', 'AC'] is not a valid run of four cards of the same colour, as it is not in sequence.
- **None:** Any combination of cards which does not correspond to one of the above group types (e.g. ['4H', '5D', '7C', 'AC']).

### Part 2 (Q2)
A function called phasedout_phase_type that takes the following single argument 'phase' where 'phase' is a combination of card groups in the form of a list of lists of cards, where each card is a 2-character string with the value (drawn from '234567890JQKA') followed by the suit (drawn from 'SHDC'), e.g. [['2C', '2S', '2H'], ['7H', '7C', 'AH']] represents an instance of two sets of three cards of the same value, as it is made up of two groups, each of which is a set of three cards of the same value.

What is returned, is one of the following values, indicating the type of the combination of card groups contained in phase:
- **1:** Two sets of three cards of the same value, e.g. [['2C', '2S', '2H'], ['7H', '7C', 'AH']] represents a set of three Twos and three Sevens. Note that each set may include Wilds (as we see in our example, with the Ace of Hearts), but must include at least two "natural" cards (i.e. non-Wild cards), which define the value.
- **2:** One set of 7 cards of the same suit, e.g. [['2C', '2C', '4C', 'KC', '9C', 'AH', 'JC']] represents a single set of seven Clubs. Note that the set may include Wilds (as we see in our example, with the Ace of Hearts), but must include at least two "natural" cards (i.e. non-Wild cards), which define the suit.
- **3:** Two sets of four cards of the same value, e.g. [['4H', '4S', 'AC', '4C'], ['7H', '7C', 'AH', 'AC']] represents a set of four Fours and a set of four Sevens. Note that each set may include Wilds (as we see in our example, with the two Aces of Clubs and Ace of Hearts), but must include at least two "natural" cards (i.e. non-Wild cards), which define the value.
- **4:** One run of eight cards, e.g. [['4H', '5S', 'AC', '7C', '8H', 'AH', '0S', 'JC']] represents a single run of eight cards. Note that the set may include Wilds (as we see in our example, with the Ace of Clubs standing in for a Six and the Ace of Hearts standing in for a Nine), but must include at least two "natural" cards (i.e. non-Wild cards). Note also that the sequence of the cards is significant for this group type, and that [['4H', '5S', 'AC', '8H', '7C', 'AH', '0S', 'JC']], e.g., is not a valid instance of this phase type, as the run is not in sequence.
- **5:** A run of four cards of the same colour and a set of four cards of the same value, e.g. [['4H', '5D', 'AC', '7H'], ['7H', '7C', 'AH', 'AS']] represents a run of four Red cards and a set of four Sevens. Note that each set may include Wilds (as we see in our example, with the Ace of Clubs standing in for a Red Six, and Ace of Hearts and Ace of Spaces standing in for Sevens), but must include at least two "natural" cards (i.e. non-Wild cards), which define the colour/value. Note also that the sequence of the cards within the run is significant for this group type, and also that the sequence of the two groups is significant, in that the run must come before the set of four.
- **None:** Any combination of groups of cards which does not correspond to one of the above phase types (e.g. [['4H', '5D', '7C', 'AC'], ['AC', 'AS', 'AS']]).

### Part 3 (Q3)
A function called phasedout_is_valid_play that takes the following arguments:
- play
  - A 2-tuple indicating the play type, and the content of the play, as follows:
    1
    Pick up a card from the top of the deck at the start of the player's turn, with the play content being the card that was picked up (e.g. (1, 'JS')).
    2
    Pick up a card from the top of the discard pile at the start of the player's turn, with the play content being the card that was picked up (e.g. (2, '2C')).
    3
    Place a phase to the table from the player's hand, with the play content being the phase (e.g. (3, [['2S', '2S', '2C'], ['AS', '5S', '5S']])).
    4
    Place a single card from the player's hand to a phase on the table, with the play content being a 2-tuple made up of the card the player is attempting to play, and the position they are attempting to play it in, itself in the form of a 3-tuple indicating: (1) the player ID of the phase the card is to be placed on; (2) the group within the phase the card is to placed in; and (3) the index of the position within the group the card is to be played to. For example, (4, ('AD', (1, 0, 3))) indicates that an Ace of Diamonds is to be placed on the phase of Player 1, in Group 1 and index position 3 (i.e. it will be the fourth card in Group 1).
    5
    Discard a single card from the player's hand, and in doing so, end the turn (e.g. (5, 'JS') indicates that a Jack of Spades is to be discarded).

- player_id
  - An integer between 0 and 3 inclusive, indicating the ID of the player attempting the play.

- table
  - A 4-element list of phase plays for each of Players 0—3, respectively. Each phase play is in the form of a 2-tuple indicating the phase content (as an integer or None, consistent with the output of phasedout_phase_type) and a list of lists of cards (of the same format as for phasedout_phase_type, but possibly with extra cards played to each of the groups in the phase). An empty phase for a given player will take the form (None, []). As an example of a full 4-player table, [(None, []), (1, [['2S', '2S', '2C'], ['AS', '5S', '5S', '5D']]), (None, []), (None, [])] indicates that Players 0, 2 and 3 are yet to play a phase for the hand, and Player 1 has played Phase 1, in the form of a set of Twos and a set of Fives, the latter of which has had one extra card added to it.

- turn_history
  - A list of all turns in the game to date, in sequence of play. Each turn takes the form of a 2-tuple made up of the Player ID and the list if individual plays in the turn (based on the same format as for play above, with the one difference that for any draws from the deck, the card is indicated as 'XX' (as it is not visible to other players). For example, [(0, [(2, 'JS'), (5, 'JS')]), (1, [(2, 'JS'), (3, [['2S', '2S', '2C'], ['AS', '5S', '5S']])])] indicates that the game to date is made up of two turns, on the part of Players 0 and 1, respectively. Player 0 first drew the Jack of Spades from the discard pile, then discarded the Jack of Spades (presumably they had a change of heart!). Player 1 then picked up the Jack of Spades from the discard pile, and played a phase, in the form of two sets of three cards of the same value (i.e. Phase 1).

- phase_status
  - A 4-element indicating the phases that each of Players 0—3, respectively, have achieved in the game. For example, [0, 4, 0, 0] indicates that Players 0, 2 and 3 have not got any phases, but Player 1 has achieved up to Phase 4. At the start of a game, this is initialised to [0, 0, 0, 0].

- hand
  - The list of cards that the current player holds in their hand, each of which is in the form of a 2-element string.

- discard
  - The top card of the discard stack, in the form of a 2-element string (e.g. '3D') or None in the case the discard pile is empty (which can only occur if no player has picked up from the deck).

The function returns a True if 'play' is valid relative to the current game state, and False otherwise. 

### Part 4 (countscores)
A function called phasedout_score that takes the following single argument: 'hand' where it is the list of cards that the current player holds in their hand, each of which is in the form of a 2-element string.

The function returns the score for the hand (assuming the game has ended, and the player is left with the cards in hand) as a non-negative integer.

### Part 5 (phasedoutAI)
A function called phasedout_play that takes the following arguments as in Part 3.

The function returns a 2-tuple describing the single play the player wishes to make, made up of a play ID and associated play content, as described below:
- **1:** Pick up a card from the top of the deck at the start of the player's turn. In this case, the card at the top of the deck is unknown at the time the play is determined, so the play content is set to None (i.e. (1, None)).
- **2:** Pick up a card from the top of the discard pile at the start of the player's turn, with the play content taking the value of discard (e.g. (2, '2C')).
- **3:** Place a phase to the table from the player's hand, with the play type being the phase (e.g. (3, [['2S', '2S', '2C'], ['AS', '5S', '5S']])).
- **4:** Place a single card from the player's hand to a phase on the table, with the play type being a 2-tuple made up of the card the player is attempting to play, and the position they are attempting to play it in, itself in the form of a 3-tuple indicating: (1) the player ID of the phase the card is to be placed on; (2) the group within the phase the card is to placed in; and (3) the index of the position within the group the card is to be played to. For example, (4, ('AD', (1, 0, 3))) indicates that an Ace of Diamonds is to be placed on the phase of Player 1, in Group 1 and index position 3 (i.e. it will be the fourth card in Group 1).
- **5:** Discard a single card from the player's hand, and in doing so, end the turn (e.g. (5, 'JS') indicates that a Jack of Spades is to be discarded).
